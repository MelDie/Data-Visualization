# Data-Visualization
In this project I am visualizing the Netflix stock data with the Python libraries Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The following data for the year of 2017 is presented and compared:
- The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
- Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
- The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
- A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017

I am using the Dow Jones Industrial Average to compare the Netflix stock to the larger stock market
